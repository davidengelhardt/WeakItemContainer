[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ktustanowski/WeakItemContainer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ktustanowski/WeakItemContainer)

Generic container for holding weak references to objects. Written in Swift 3.0.

#When to use
When you have to store:

* Unique item

list of objects but you don't want them to be retained. [Multicast delegate pattern](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2012/11/19/a-multicast-delegate-pattern-for-ios-controls.html) - when you have to maintain lists of delegates and, heavens forbid, you don't want them to be retained - is one of the examples.
